# None obvious features
Our graphs heavily rely on the ability to hover over elements and click-and-drag (for the filtering, for example).  It is highly recommended to use a computer with mouse/touchpad to see full functionality.

For exact count/value amounts on a given graph, hover over an individual bar on the graph.

Filtering is specific to the selected graph.  If you select a different graph, the filtering view will update.

# Implementation (Code)
See the `implementation` folder.
All code is original, except where cited.  Libraries are retrieved inside the head of each html file (i.e. no library is included in the implementation folder).
